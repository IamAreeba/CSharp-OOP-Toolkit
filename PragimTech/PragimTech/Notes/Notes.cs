 * This:
 *  this refers to an instance of that class to an object of this class. Why?
 *  cuz when we use . on this it show all the fields of the class
 *  
 *  Destructors:
 *   Destructors dont have param and no return type. It is use to clean up the resources your class was holding on during its   lifetime . Any code which is holding something we put them in destructors.
 *   Destructors is automatically called by the garbage colllector when it tries to clean obj from memory
